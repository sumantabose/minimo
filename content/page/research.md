## Current Research

My current work is on full-stack distributed ledger technology system research, with specialization in blockchain implementation and application.

### Distributed Ledger Technology
Distributed ledgers are managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to some consensus protocol. A blockchain is only one type of data structure considered to be a distributed ledger, that was originally designed to be open, permissionless and public for cryptocurrencies. However, over time several access controlled, permissioned and private alternatives have evolved for catering to large-scale multi-party transaction management applications undertaken by industries and corporations. An all-encompassing central requirement of both permissionless and permissioned blockchains is its privacy and security guarantees. While the privacy and security issues in permissionless blockchains are well understood and dealt with, those in permissioned blockchains are still sparse and under-reported. This is despite the fact that the use of permissioned blockchains is on a rapid rise for both commercial and academic fronts. 

One of my major recent works is on the security and privacy studies of different blockchain flavours, and other types of distributed ledgers including Iota, Tangle and Hedera Hashgraph.

### Blockchain Implementation
Blockchain enabled supply chain transaction management can help participants to effectively record price, date, location, quality, certification, and other relevant information. The availability of this information in the blockchain can increase traceability of material supply, lower losses from counterfeit and gray market, improve visibility and compliance over outsourced contract manufacturing, and potentially enhance an organization's position in responsible manufacturing. Blockchain driven innovations in the supply chain will have the potential to deliver tremendous business value by increasing transparency, reducing risk, and improving overall supply chain efficiency.

My current project is on *Cybersecurity Protocol and Mechanism for e-Logistics of Dangerous Goods Tracking using Blockchain Supply Chain Management*.

Additionally I've also worked on IC Manufacturing using blockchain, and more recently on blockchain enabled autonomous vehicle secure data management.

### Blockchain Software
I have woking experience on Ethereum and Hyperledger. See my Github for more details.

Additionally, I'm involved in the development of our group's own Blockchain-as-a-service app that allows users (clients) to invoke a host (server) running a blockchain enabled ledger -- to maintain, retrieve and search supply chain transaction records, that are securely logged in into the blockchain. The API functions as a remote web service which allows users to use our blockchain enabled distributed ledger platform from a website, software or mobile application. The API gives access to all of the supported functions of our service. The web service uses *REST-like* RPC-style operations over HTTP POST requests with parameterized URL encoded into the request and its response is encoded in JSON. It is designed to be easy to use and users can implement it in any model computer language that allows them to generate TCP requests.
